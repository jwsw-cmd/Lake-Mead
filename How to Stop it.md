# Get Local & Organize

#### •  Show up and fight proposals:

 Local opposition has blocked or delayed $64 billion in projects nationwide (Chandler AZ unanimous council rejection, Loudoun County VA moratorium pushes, Tucson fights). Attend zoning hearings, city councils, planning commissions, pack them with neighbors raising water/power/noise concerns.

#### •  Join/form groups: 

Over 140 activist orgs in 24 states (Sierra Club locals, Clean Water Action, civic groups) are coordinating. In VA (data center capital), 42 groups alone are battling expansions.

#### •  Demand moratoriums: 

230+ environmental groups (led by Food & Water Watch) called for a national pause in Dec 2025, push your reps to back it.

# Pressure Politicians & Regulators

#### •  State-level wins incoming: 

# Bills in VA, MD, CA, NJ, IL pushing mandatory water/power reporting, ending secrecy, tiered rates (make centers pay fair share), incentives for renewables/zero-water cooling, and buffers from homes. VA’s new Dem gov (2026) vows community input \+ no strained resources.

#### •  Federal action: 

# DOE pushing FERC for faster interconnections but with rules, support calls for transparency (no uniform water reporting yet) and make Big Tech cover grid upgrades (not ratepayers).

#### •  Utility fights: 

# Oppose rate hikes, intervene like Tucson did in 2025\.

# Force Tech Accountability

# •  Demand transparency: 

# Companies hide numbers, push for full water/energy disclosures (Google/MSFT “net positive water” goals by 2030 are PR without enforcement).

# •  Boycott/amplify: 

# Share exposes (like yours), tag companies, support shareholder pressure for reclaimed water/immersion cooling (cuts evaporation 90–100%).

# •  Site smarter: 

# Advocate relocating to wetter grids (Oregon/Midwest wind/hydro) over drought zones with subsidies.

# It’s not hopeless, 2025 elections flipped on rising bills (NJ, VA, GA wins for anti-center candidates). Grassroots is winning battles, scaling it up in 2026 sessions. Start local, go loud, and hold tech/pols accountable before the next hyperscaler sucks your watershed dry.
